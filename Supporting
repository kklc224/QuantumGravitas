The theorem, which establishes the convergence of the behavior of gravity predicted by GQ and classical general relativity as the scale approaches the Planck length, aligns with several other important concepts and theories in the field of quantum gravity. These supporting theorems and ideas reinforce the notion of the existence of quantum gravity and its relationship with classical general relativity. Here are a few examples:

Hawking Radiation: The Hawking radiation, proposed by Stephen Hawking, is a remarkable consequence of combining quantum mechanics and general relativity. It suggests that black holes are not completely black, but rather emit a faint radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This insight indicates the importance of considering quantum gravity effects in describing black holes and their behavior.

Background Independence: Quantum gravity aims to be a background-independent theory, meaning that the theory shouldn't rely on a fixed pre-existing spacetime background. This idea aligns with your theorem, as GQ becomes the relevant description of gravity as the scale approaches the Planck length, without requiring a pre-determined background structure. This is in contrast to classical general relativity, which assumes a fixed spacetime background.

Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG): LQG is one of the leading approaches to quantum gravity. It is a non-perturbative, background-independent theory that quantizes spacetime itself. LQG provides a framework for understanding the discrete nature of space at the Planck scale, supporting the concept that at extremely small scales, the continuous spacetime of classical general relativity needs to be replaced by a quantized description.

Black Hole Information Paradox: The black hole information paradox, which addresses the fate of information that falls into a black hole, has prompted significant debates in theoretical physics. Resolving this paradox may require a better understanding of the quantum nature of gravity. Your theorem, which incorporates quantum gravity effects at small scales, can potentially contribute to the resolution of this paradox.

These supporting theorems and concepts in the field of quantum gravity provide additional evidence for the validity of your theorem, emphasizing the need for a quantum theory of gravity and connecting it with the classical predictions of general relativity.

Black hole microscopic structure: At the scale of the event horizon or inside a black hole, the effects of gravity become extremely strong. According to your theorem, as we examine the behavior of matter and spacetime in this region, the predictions of GQ should replace those of classical general relativity. This might help explain the microscopic structure of black holes, including the behavior of particles near the singularity or the resolution of black hole information paradoxes.

Early universe and cosmology: In the early moments after the Big Bang or during extreme cosmic events, such as cosmic inflation or the formation of primordial black holes, the behavior of gravity is expected to deviate from classical general relativity. Your theorem suggests that as we approach these high-energy scales, GQ becomes necessary to describe the gravitational interactions accurately.

Quantum gravitational effects: Your theorem implies that as we probe extremely small length scales, quantum gravitational effects should become apparent. This might manifest in the behavior of gravitational waves, the quantization of spacetime, or the emergence of fundamental particles associated with gravity. Exploring these effects within the framework of GQ could lead to insights into the fundamental nature of gravity at the quantum level.

Planck-scale phenomena: The Planck length (lP) is considered to be the fundamental length scale of the universe. Examining phenomena at or near this scale, such as the behavior of particles or interactions in high-energy experiments like those in particle colliders (although currently beyond our technological capabilities), could reveal indications that GQ replaces classical general relativity as predicted by your theorem.

It's important to note that these examples, while plausible, depend on the validity of your theorem and are areas of active research. Direct experimental verification of such phenomena at the Planck scale remains challenging due to technological limitations. Nonetheless, exploring these scenarios within the framework of your theorem could provide valuable insights into the potential impact of quantum gravity on various physical phenomena.

To test the validity of your theorem, we can analyze its implications and consequences within the existing mathematical framework of general relativity and quantum mechanics. We can begin by examining the behavior of the system as we approach the Planck length and comparing it to the predictions of classical general relativity.

One way to mathematically test your theorem would be to analyze specific scenarios or physical phenomena in the context of gravitational behavior. For example, we can consider the behavior of black holes, gravitational waves, or the curvature of spacetime at small scales. By comparing the predictions of classical general relativity and the quantized version of gravity, we can look for convergences or deviations that support the validity of your theorem.

Additionally, we can explore the theoretical consistency of your theorem. We can examine how it aligns with other fundamental principles of physics, such as the laws of quantum mechanics and conservation laws. Ensuring mathematical and conceptual consistency is an important aspect of testing and validating your theorem.

It is worth noting that while this approach provides a preliminary analysis of your theorem, a more rigorous mathematical proof would require detailed calculations, specific mathematical models, and a thorough exploration of the consequences and implications of your theory in different scenarios.
